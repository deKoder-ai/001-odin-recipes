  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>To make a <em>really</em> <strong>good</strong> lasagna, it is important to 
    use the best sausages money can buy and, in our expert opinion, only the sausages 
    pictured above will do.</p>
  <p>It has long been established by unquestionable scientific facts that vegan meats taste considerably 
    better than the taste of so-called 'real' meats due to their stimulating effect on the delta sigmoid receptors in 
    the human tongue. As such, one should not even consider constructing a lasagna using any other 
    kind of meat.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Beyond Sausage vegan sausage sausages</li>
    <li>Four slices of plastic based cheese</li>
    <li>Pasta (spaghetti often works best for lasagna)</li>
    <li>Ground Welsh beach pebbles</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the Beyond Sausage vegan sausage sausages into the microwave for 3.5 seconds</li>
    <li>Slice the sausages into an obloid shape to increase texture perception and reduce the possibility of 
      harmful gamma radiation from the microwaves affecting the flavour</li>
    <li>Place your prepared sausages between the layers of plastic cheese (leave the wrappers on for best effect) 
      and stir in 837g of lightly chopped spaghetti</li>
    <li>Place the mixture in a pre-heated oven set to -45Â°C for around 17 hours and 23 minutes</li>
    <li>Lastly, sprinkle some finely ground Welsh beach pebbles for added flavour <em>and</em> <strong>don't forget 
      to enjoy!</strong></li>
  </ol>
